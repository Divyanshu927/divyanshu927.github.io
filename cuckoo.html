			  <b>Cuckoo And Happiness</b>
			  <p>Cuckoo is like my happiness<p> 
<p>And spring shows its existence<p>
<p> But the time is of winter<p>
<p>Never ending winter<p>
<p> Or maybe I don't want it to end<p> 
<p>The winter has become cuckoo's pleasure<p>
<p>Spring may Come back<p>
<p>Cuckoo may show that it exists<p>
<p>But i resist spring<p>
<p>This winter will remain forever<p>
<p>Cuckoo will cease to exist<p>
<p>The winter will never end<p>
