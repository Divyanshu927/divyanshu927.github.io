<b>Hope</b>
<p>Ohh, I've seen it, seen it, seen it<p>
<p>The bubbles of hope forming<p>
<p>Ohh I've done it done it done it<p>
<p>Bursted the bubbles of hope<p>
<p>Ohh I've seen it, seen it seen it<p>
<p>The full moon in clear sky<p>
<p>Ohh I've done it, done it, done it<p>
<p>Blurred my vision with hands<p>
<p>Ohh sun show that there's day<p>
<p>I've seen enough moon<p>
<p>I've seen enough night<p>
<p>I can tolerate the heat <p>
<p>Just show me the day<p>
<p>Show me, show me, show me.<p>
